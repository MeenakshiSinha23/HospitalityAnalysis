Key Components of the Hospitality Data Analysis Project – Power BI
The Hospitality Data Analysis Project begins with data collection and cleaning, where raw data from sources like Excel, CSV, or SQL databases is imported into Power BI. Using Power Query, the data is cleaned by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats for consistency. The next step involves data modeling, where relationships between tables such as bookings, customers, and revenue data are established. This ensures efficient data aggregation and accurate insights. DAX functions are applied to create calculated fields, such as average stay duration and revenue per guest, enhancing the analytical capabilities of the model.

The project’s core includes data visualization and analysis through interactive Power BI dashboards. Key metrics are displayed using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, providing insights into revenue trends, occupancy rates, and booking sources. The dashboard also features KPI cards that highlight total revenue, customer satisfaction scores, and average stay durations. Interactive filters allow users to segment data by date range, location, or booking source, making the analysis dynamic and insightful. Finally, the project delivers data-driven recommendations, such as optimizing pricing strategies, identifying peak booking periods, and suggesting customer retention initiatives based on the trends observed.
